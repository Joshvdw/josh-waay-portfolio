  bio: `I’m Josh. Although I’m originally from Amsterdam, I moved to New Zealand in my youth and am now a freelance web developer based in Pōneke (Wellington).

I’m driven by an innate curiosity to learn new tech. I love creating immersive experiences that push the boundaries of the web. My favourite frontend framework is React.

I have a diverse creative background, that ranges from professional video editing to music production and sound design. This has helped me carve out a unique niche in my career.

In my spare time I like to make music, read and travel the world.

I’m always open to new projects, so please feel free to reach out any time!
